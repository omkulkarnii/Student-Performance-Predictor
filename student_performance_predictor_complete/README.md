#  Student Performance Predictor

This project analyzes student data and builds a machine learning model to predict academic performance (grades or pass/fail).

##  Project Highlights
- Clean and explore real-world educational data
- Visualize performance trends based on gender, study time, family background, etc.
- Train a predictive model using decision trees or random forests
- Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw student dataset (`student-mat.csv`)
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook with EDA and visualizations
- `src/`: Modular Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and predicting

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. Open `notebooks/student_eda.ipynb` to explore the data
3. Use `src/train_model.py` to train the model
4. Predict new data using `src/predict.py`

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning, analysis, visualization
- Feature engineering
- Classification model building and evaluation
